== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add a new portfolio item to the grid? =
On the WordPress dashboard you will see a button labeled 'Portfolio Item'.  By clicking into that dashboard section you can see a list of every Portfolio Item and you can add a new one here too.

= How do I show the Portfolio Grid on a page? =
The simplest way to show the Portfolio grid on a page is to add the 'Portfolio Page' block to a page.  If you want to use a shortcode to place the portfolio, just add the shortcode block to a page and enter `[portfolio_page]`.

= How do I set the image shown in the grid? =
Create a new Portfolio item from the dashboard.  Click in to edit that item and on the bottom right is a place to set the featured image.  That is the image that will show for that grid item.

= When I click into an item to view more info about that item, how many alternate shots of the item may I set? =
You can set up to 5 alternate shots of a given item, fewer is fine and the featured image does not count as an item.
